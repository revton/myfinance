# Draft PR: UX Improvements Phase 2 - Transaction and Dashboard Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This PR includes several important fixes and improvements to the application:

### 1. Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" error
- **Problem**: Infinite loop causing the application to crash on the transactions page
- **Root Cause**: Circular dependencies between components and hooks
- **Solution**: 
  - Refactored `AdvancedFilters` component to be a controlled component
  - Fixed filter components (`DateRangeFilter`, `AmountRangeFilter`, `StatusFilter`, `CategoryFilter`) to track previous prop values
  - Improved `useAdvancedFilters` and `useLocalStorage` hooks to prevent unnecessary state updates

### 2. Fixed hardcoded "Gastos por Categoria" dashboard data
- **Problem**: Dashboard was showing static dummy data instead of real expense data
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `useCategories` hook to calculate real expense data from transactions
  - Enhanced `CategorySummaryCard` to display accurate expense information by category
  - Added proper loading and empty states

### 3. Fixed transaction updates not refreshing data
- **Problem**: After editing a transaction, the changes weren't reflected in the transactions list or dashboard
- **Solution**:
  - Modified `TransactionFormPage` to refresh transaction data after updates
  - Updated Transaction interfaces to match backend models
  - Ensured consistent data flow across all components

### 4. Added Playwright for E2E testing
- Added Playwright configuration and initial test for transactions page

## What Should Be Tested

### 1. Transactions Page
- [ ] Verify that the page loads without infinite loop errors
- [ ] Check that filters work correctly and don't cause performance issues
- [ ] Test that adding, editing, and deleting transactions works properly
- [ ] Confirm that transaction list updates immediately after changes

### 2. Dashboard Page
- [ ] Verify that "Gastos por Categoria" shows real expense data instead of static values
- [ ] Check that category expenses update when transactions are modified
- [ ] Confirm that percentages and amounts are calculated correctly
- [ ] Test that the pie chart displays accurate data

### 3. Category Management
- [ ] Test that category creation, editing, and deletion works properly
- [ ] Verify that category changes are reflected in transactions and dashboard

### 4. General Performance
- [ ] Check that there are no infinite loop errors or performance issues
- [ ] Verify that all components load and update data correctly
- [ ] Test that navigation between pages works smoothly

### 5. Playwright Tests
- [ ] Run Playwright tests to verify the transactions page loads correctly
- [ ] Confirm that no console errors appear during normal usage

## How to Test

1. Start the application normally
2. Navigate to the Transactions page and verify it loads without errors
3. Test all filter functionalities on the Transactions page
4. Create, edit, and delete some transactions
5. Navigate to the Dashboard and verify that "Gastos por Categoria" shows real data

- Real expense data displayed in the Dashboard category summary
- Immediate UI updates after transaction modifications
- Smooth performance with no infinite loops or excessive re-renders
