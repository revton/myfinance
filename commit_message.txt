fix(frontend): Resolve 401 Unauthorized error in CategoryContext

Ensures that API requests from CategoryContext always include the
authentication token by explicitly setting the Authorization header
for each request. This bypasses potential timing issues with Axios
interceptors and resolves the 401 Unauthorized error when fetching categories.
